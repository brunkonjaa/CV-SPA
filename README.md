CV-SPA - Bruno Suric
Live Demo: https://brunkonjaa.github.io/CV-SPA/
A mobile-friendly CV website built with Bootstrap that splits your info across multiple pages instead of one long scroll. It keeps the same purple and red colors throughout
 
What This Project Does
A website CV made with:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Bootstrap 5
•	JavaScript
It has pages for:
•	Home
•	Education
•	Work History
•	Skills
•	Extra Info
•	Summary
•	Projects
•	Cover Letter in the documents folder
 
Cool Things It Does
•	Dark / Light Mode — remembers which one you picked using your browser's memory
•	Easy Navigation — Bootstrap menu bar on every page that shows which page you're on
•	Nice Layouts — Cards sit next to each other on computers but stack on phones
•	Project Gallery — shows your work in columns with links to tests, code, and study stuff
•	Cover Letter Page — lets people download your PDF and see your photo using the same design
 
How Files Are Organized
•	css/style.css — Colors, backgrounds, and how things look
•	js/app.js — Changes between light/dark, menu collapse, scroll to top
•	images/myphoto.png — Your picture on the cover letter page
•	pages/education.html
•	pages/experience.html
•	pages/skills.html
•	pages/additional.html
•	pages/summary.html
•	pages/projects.html
•	cover_letter/index.html — Cover letter page with button to go back home
•	index.html — Main page people see first
 
How to Run It on Your Computer
1.	git clone https://github.com/brunkonjaa/CV-SPA.git
2.	Open index.html (or any page in the pages folder)
3.	That's it — no complicated setup needed
 
Where It Lives Online
Hosted on GitHub Pages using the main branch. The redirect makes sure the new folder setup works with the existing web address: https://brunkonjaa.github.io/CV-SPA/
 
How It Was Built
•	Bootstrap handles layout and spacing while custom CSS creates the colors and textures
•	JavaScript manages the theme switcher, collapsing menu, and smooth animations — no single-page tricks
•	Files are sorted into css, js, and images folders to keep things organized and load faster
