# Bootstrap Components Added or Modified

- Standardised a reusable `navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark` block across every page, preserving the translucent styling.
- Kept the Bootstrap bundle to power the hamburger toggler and reused collapse auto-hide logic in the multi-page script.
- Leveraged `h-100`, `d-flex`, and button utilities to keep cards and action rows level when rendered side by side.
- Brought the cover letter into the same component system (card + grid) so the PDF download and portrait align with the CV styling.
- Retained bespoke buttons and surfaces while delegating spacing and responsiveness to Bootstrap utilities.
