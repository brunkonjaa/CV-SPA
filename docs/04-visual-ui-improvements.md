# Visual/UI Improvements (Excluding Color Changes)

- Reduced scrolling by presenting cards side by side on every page, letting key facts surface above the fold
- Adjusted hero layout to pair narrative copy with quick facts, giving visitors context and credentials at a glance
- Kept navigation consistent while ensuring the theme toggle sits neatly within the nav for all breakpoints
- Balanced card heights with h-100 so rows remain tidy when content lengths differ
- Integrated cover letter photography and PDF call-to-action within the shared card aesthetic for visual cohesion
